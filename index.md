## Hello! I'm Xinran Zhang 👋

I am a Master's student in **Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University**, working on **physical-signal foundation models for industrial and robotic systems**.

My research explores how non-text physical signals — such as **vibration, tactile, and acoustic signals** — can be represented, aligned, and reasoned over by **large language models and multimodal foundation models**, with applications in **industrial diagnosis, robotic perception, and intelligent operation & maintenance**.

## 🔬 Research Vision

Modern industrial and robotic systems continuously generate rich physical signals, including vibration, tactile, acoustic, force, and other sensor measurements. However, most existing foundation models are primarily designed for text, images, or videos, while physical signals remain underrepresented in the current multimodal AI landscape.

My long-term research goal is to develop **foundation-model-based physical signal intelligence**:  
building unified representations, cross-modal alignment methods, and reliable reasoning frameworks that connect physical signals with **language, vision, and action spaces**.

I am particularly interested in three directions:

- **Physical-signal foundation models** for vibration, tactile, and acoustic signal understanding
- **Robot tactile perception and embodied physical-signal modeling**
- **Industrial AI agents**, intelligent maintenance, and digital-twin systems powered by LLMs

## 🧩 Earlier Research Experience

### Vision-based Local Map Construction for Autonomous Driving

**This undergraduate thesis explored end-to-end local HD map construction for autonomous driving by transforming multi-view camera images into bird's-eye-view map representations.**

I reproduced and implemented a deep-learning-based BEV map construction framework using NuScenes surround-view camera images. The pipeline includes image feature extraction, BEV view transformation, map-element decoding, and vectorized reconstruction of lane dividers, pedestrian crossings, and road boundaries with piecewise Bezier curves.

**Highlights:** autonomous driving · BEV perception · local HD map construction · Transformer · Swin Transformer · BiFPN · Mask2Former · piecewise Bezier curve

**Results:** trained and evaluated on NuScenes; achieved **42.6 mAP@HARD** and **61.4 mAP@EASY** over three static map-element categories; showed higher average AP than IPM, LSS, VPN, and HDMapNet baselines under the same 30-epoch evaluation setting.

**Status:** Undergraduate thesis · Awarded Excellent Undergraduate Thesis at Hunan University
